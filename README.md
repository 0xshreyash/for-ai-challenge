# Gotta prune 'em all

This is Shreyash Patodia's submission to for.ai's pruning challenge.

Reproducing the results from this notebook/colab should be as simple as running all the cells in order!

I've tried to add some context using text and comments to make things easier to understand.

Please feel free to contact me if something isn't clear about my submission!
